# Harry-Potter-RNN
A recurrent neural network that was trained using the entire text of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" to generate new Harry Potter text.

If attempting to train this on your own computer, I highly reccommend that you use a GPU, as recurrent neural networks take a long time to train.
